# Objectify---Object-Detector
My app Objectify consists of 2 main functions which result in many outputs which are text, image and speech output helping all users at the same time! Well, what does my app even do? It basically scans and recognizes what objects are evident in any picture which you have uploaded to the machine and the results come in three ways as I have mentioned above and it tries to help the users as much as it can as after all the application is really user friendly! The last function of the machine is the feedback option which allows a user to share their experience and opinion towards the application! 

Objectify is a fully functioning machine which can scan objects around it through pictures and even gives a speech output of their names. The purpose of my app is to help visually impaired people or anyone with some sort of disability! In a way, I want to create my app as a lifeline for those who find difficulties in doing simple everyday tasks which is the main motive of my app!


Thank you for your time :)
